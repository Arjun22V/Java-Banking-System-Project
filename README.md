ðŸš€ Java Banking System Project

I recently developed a simple Banking System in Java using Scanner for user input and switch-case for menu-driven operations.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

User details input (Name, Age, Gender, Balance)

Account Operations:
âœ… Withdrawal (with PIN validation & balance update)
âœ… Deposit (secure deposit with balance update)
âœ… Loan system (supports Personal, Home, and Education loans with 2% processing charges)

Language Selection: Telugu, English, Hindi

PIN authentication for secure transactions

ðŸ’¡ This project gave me hands-on experience in Java basics, conditional statements, switch-case, loops, and input handling, while simulating real-world banking operations.

ðŸ›  Tech Used: Java (Core), Scanner Class, OOP Basics

This project helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and understand how banking workflows can be simulated in software systems.
